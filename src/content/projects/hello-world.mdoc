This was built in Astro and Typescript, Thinkmill's Keystatic CMS as the content management system. I don't know if I never noticed it or if this was recent, but Astro's content collection's `date` type had an option to coerce strings into dates. I feel a bit silly for never noticing it!

Anyway, I hope you enjoy browsing my portfolio. :)
