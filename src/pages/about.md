# More about me...

My name is Rhys Kim, and I'm obsessed with making usable experiences for everyone!

Here are some of the resources I used to create this portfolio:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/), to build and generate the website
- [Terminal Grotesque](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/terminal-grotesque/) by Raphaël Bastide, with the contribution of Jérémy Landes. Distributed by velvetyne.fr.
- [Schemist](https://schemist.fglt.fr), to generate all the colors used on this website
- [Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com), to preview a look for the website
- [Deta Space](https://deta.space/), to host the portfolio
